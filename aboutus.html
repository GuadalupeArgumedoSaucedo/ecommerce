                                <p>Welcome to Retro Rhythm's story, where our love for all things retro began a
                                    community of
                                    enthusiasts. Back in 2006, a group of friends bonded over their shared passion for
                                    vintage
                                    records, classic video games, and timeless comics. They dreamed of sharing this
                                    passion with
                                    others and created Retro Rhythm. Starting small, we built our collection by hunting
                                    for
                                    treasures at flea markets and garage sales. As we grew, so did our community.
                                    Through social
                                    media and events, we connected with retro lovers worldwide. Today, Retro Rhythm is a
                                    hub for
                                    retro enthusiasts everywhere. We continue to expand our collection, adding new
                                    products and
                                    partnerships. Our mission remains simple: to celebrate the nostalgia of yesteryear
                                    and share
                                    it with the world. Join us on this journey through time as we keep the retro rhythm
